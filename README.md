# Tic-Tac-Toe-SFML
This repository is my first approach to the SFML library.
I'm sure there are many better ways to implement Tic-Tac-Toe, but I wanted to do it my way.
If I were to do this project from scratch, I would probably change a lot of things, because I learned a lot while looking for solutions to problems I encountered.
